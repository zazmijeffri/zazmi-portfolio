      <h3>Academic Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I earned my <strong>Diploma in Computer Networking</strong> back in 2012, and now I’m currently working toward a
        <strong>Degree in Information Technology</strong>. Along the way, I have worked with industry leaders like Dell and Western Digital, where I honed my skills in diagnosing technical issues, managing support cases, and ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction.
        Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I’m eager to grow professionally and contribute to innovative teams that value technical excellence and continuous improvement.
      </p>

      <h3>Mission & Values</h3>
      <p>
        I am dedicated to <strong>value</strong>, <strong>innovation</strong>, and <strong>lifelong learning</strong>. I believe technology should do more than just fix problems — it should create lasting impact through smart, forward-thinking solutions. I'm always up for a challenge and see every experience as a chance to grow. 
        Whether it's improving a process or exploring something new, I'm constantly learning, adapting, and looking ahead — especially when it comes to emerging trends.
      </p>

      <h3>Career Goals</h3>
      <p>
        I aspire to become a <strong>System Administrator</strong> or <strong>IT Operations Manager</strong>. As a dedicated IT professional with a strong background in technical support, system troubleshooting, and customer service, I aim to grow by tackling complex challenges that enhance system performance and user experience.
        My passion for innovation and continuous learning drives me to contribute to dynamic teams in areas like IT infrastructure, remote support, and technical operations.
